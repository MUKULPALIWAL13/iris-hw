# **Wishbone Protocol**
- Wishbone is an open-source hardware interconnect protocol that ensures seamless integration of various Intellectual Properties (IPs) without vendor dependency.
- It supports two key transaction signals:
  - **CYC (Cycle Signal):** Marks the beginning of a transaction.
  - **STB (Strobe Signal):** Indicates that valid data is available for transfer.
- Other essential signals in the protocol include:
  - **ACK (Acknowledge Signal):** Confirms the successful reception of data.
  - **DAT (Data Signal):** Represents the actual data being transmitted.
  - **ADR (Address Signal):** Specifies the memory location or register being accessed.
- The transaction process begins with the master initiating communication, after which the slave responds. Once the master receives an acknowledgment (ACK), the transaction is considered complete, ensuring data integrity and correctness.

# **AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface)**
- AXI, developed by ARM, is a high-performance protocol designed to support multiple concurrent transactions, enabling efficient data transfer.
- It is categorized into three types:
  - **AXI:** Full-featured, supporting burst-based transactions.
  - **AXI Lite:** A simplified version for low-throughput applications, lacking burst capability.
  - **AXI Stream:** Optimized for high-speed data streaming without addressing.
- AXI transactions are managed through five independent channels:
  - **Read Address Channel:** Specifies the memory location for a read operation.
  - **Read Data Channel:** Transfers the requested data to the master.
  - **Write Address Channel:** Defines the memory location for a write operation.
  - **Write Data Channel:** Sends data from the master to the slave.
  - **Write Response Channel:** Confirms the completion of a write transaction.
- Each channel utilizes **VALID** and **READY** handshaking signals to ensure reliable data transfer.

# **CHI (Coherent Hub Interface)**
- CHI is a high-performance interconnect protocol designed for large-scale multiprocessor systems, ensuring data coherency across multiple processing nodes.
- It consists of three key nodes:
  - **Requesting Node (RN):** Initiates transactions.
  - **Home Node (HN):** Manages coherency and data access.
  - **Subordinate Node (SN):** Provides data when requested.
- CHI transactions involve four primary types of messages:
  - **Request Messages:** Sent by the requesting node to access data.
  - **Response Messages:** Acknowledgments from the home or subordinate node.
  - **Snoop Messages:** Used for cache coherency by querying other nodes.
  - **Data Messages:** Carry the actual data payload.
- It supports different coherence models:
  - **Fully Coherent (RN-F):** Ensures complete data consistency across all nodes.
  - **IO Coherent (RN-I):** Provides partial coherence for input/output operations.
  - **IO Coherent with DVM (RN-D):** Adds Distributed Virtual Memory (DVM) support for system-wide coherency.
- CHI features **3 TX (Transmit) and 3 RX (Receive) channels** for efficient data flow.
- It maintains cache coherency using cache states such as **SC (Shared Clean), SD (Shared Dirty), UC (Unique Clean), UD (Unique Dirty), and I (Invalid).**
